Images are the largest source of data in healthcare and, at the same time, one of
the most difficult sources to analyze. Clinicians today must rely largely on medical
image analysis performed by overworked radiologists and sometimes analyze scans
themselves. Computer vision software based on the latest deep learning algorithms
is already enabling the automated analysis to provide accurate results that are
delivered immeasurably faster than the manual process can achieve. Multimodal
medical imaging can provide us with separate yet complementary structure and
function information of a patient study and hence has transformed the way we
study living bodies. The motivation for multimodal imaging is to obtain a superior
exquisite image that will provide accurate and reliable statistics than any single
image while retaining the best functions for the snapshots software program for
medically testing, diagnosing and curing diseases.
Diagnostic tools include Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and thus these are the two modalities that we will consider for
Image Fusion Process.
We aim to approach a three step process:
1. Image Registration
2. Image Fusion
3. Image Segmentation
